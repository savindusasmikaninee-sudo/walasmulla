          <h2>Population and Demographics</h2>

          <h3>Community Composition</h3>
          <p>
            The majority of Walasmulla's population comprises Sinhala Buddhists
            who have maintained their cultural and religious traditions across
            generations. The community's occupational structure reflects the
            rural character of the area, with most families involved in
            agriculture—either as landowners, tenant farmers, or agricultural
            laborers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond farming, significant numbers work in small-scale trade,
            operating shops and businesses that serve local needs. These include
            general stores, hardware shops, agricultural supply stores, textile
            shops, and restaurants that cater to both residents and travelers
            passing through the town.
          </p>

            <h3>Livelihoods and Employment</h3>
            <p>
              Government employment provides stable income for many families,
              with residents working as teachers, administrators, health
              workers, and in various public service roles. The presence of
              schools, government offices, and health facilities creates
              employment opportunities beyond agriculture and creates a mix of
              rural and professional lifestyles within the community.

          <p>
            This mix of agricultural, commercial, and public sector employment
            creates a relatively stable economic base while maintaining the
            town's rural identity and traditional way of life. The
            intergenerational transfer of agricultural land and knowledge
            ensures continuity of farming practices, while increased educational
            opportunities allow younger generations to pursue diverse career
            paths without necessarily leaving their home community.
