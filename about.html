          <div class="highlight">
            <h3>🗺️ Strategic Location</h3>
            <p>
              Walasmulla occupies a strategic position in the Hambantota
              District, situated between the coastal town of Tangalle, the
              inland hub of Embilipitiya, and the agricultural center of
              Katuwana. This geographical positioning has naturally evolved the
              town into a crucial nexus for trade, transportation, and education
              in the region.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Geographic Significance</h3>
          <p>
            The landscape around Walasmulla is dominated by expansive paddy
            fields that transform with the seasons—lush green during
            cultivation, golden during harvest, and mirror-like when flooded for
            planting. These agricultural plains are interspersed with natural
            forests, village tanks, and meandering streams, creating a
            picturesque rural panorama that defines the region's character.

          <h2>Historical Journey</h2>

          <div class="highlight">
            <h3>🐻 Origins: The Bear's Corner</h3>
            <p>
              The history of Walasmulla is deeply rooted in Sri Lanka's
              agricultural heritage and wildlife landscape. Centuries ago, this
              region was covered in dense forests that served as habitat for
              diverse wildlife, particularly the Sri Lankan sloth bear, known
              locally as "Walas." The town's name itself—Walasmulla—derives from
              this historical connection: "Walas" referring to bears and "Mulla"
              meaning corner or area, literally translating to "Bear's Corner"
              or "Area of Bears."
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Evolution Through Time</h3>
          <p>
            Early inhabitants practiced traditional agriculture, cultivating
            paddy in the fertile lowlands where water could be retained, and
            engaging in chena farming on the hillier terrain. These agricultural
            practices shaped the settlement patterns and community structures
            that still influence the town today.

          <h3>Colonial Period Transformation</h3>
          <p>
            The colonial period brought significant changes to Walasmulla.
            British administrators recognized the importance of connecting
            agricultural regions to markets and ports, leading to the
            development of road infrastructure. These roads not only facilitated
            the transport of agricultural goods but also opened the town to
            broader economic and social influences.
          </p>

          <h3>Post-Independence Development</h3>
          <p>
            Following Sri Lanka's independence in 1948, Walasmulla experienced
            accelerated development. The post-independence government
            prioritized rural development, investing in road improvements,
            irrigation systems, and educational facilities. This period saw the
            town transform from a collection of agricultural villages into a
            more organized administrative and commercial center, while still
            maintaining its rural character and agricultural foundation.
