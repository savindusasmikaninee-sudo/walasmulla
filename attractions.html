          <h2>Key Attractions</h2>
          <p>
            Walasmulla and its surrounding areas offer visitors and residents a
            blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and rural charm. The
            attractions reflect the authentic rural Sri Lankan experience rather
            than commercialized tourism.
          </p>

          <h3>Natural and Rural Scenery</h3>
          <p>
            The landscape itself is the primary attraction—vast expanses of
            paddy fields that change color with the seasons, traditional village
            tanks that serve both practical and aesthetic purposes, and the
            peaceful rural setting that offers respite from urban congestion.
            The agricultural scenery, particularly during the golden harvest
            season, provides photographers and nature lovers with stunning
            vistas.

            <p>
              The Katuwana Clock Tower stands as both an architectural landmark
              and a symbol of community identity. More than just a timekeeper,
              this structure serves as a central reference point for the
              community, marking the town center where roads converge and social
              life concentrates.

            practical and visually significant in the rural landscape.

          <h3>Cultural and Social Significance</h3>
          <p>
            The clock tower has become a meeting point, a landmark for giving
            directions, and a source of local pride, embodying the community's
            connection to both tradition and progress. Local residents often use
            it as a reference point: "meet me at the clock tower" or "turn left
            after the clock tower" are common phrases in daily conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond its practical functions, the clock tower holds symbolic
            value. It represents the community's investment in public
            infrastructure, the importance of punctuality and organization in
            civic life, and the desire to create landmarks that give the town a
            distinctive identity.
          </p>

          <h3>Markets and Local Life</h3>
          <p>
            The local markets buzz with activity, especially on designated
            market days when farmers bring fresh produce, vendors sell household
            goods, and the community gathers to trade and socialize. These
            markets offer an authentic glimpse into rural commercial life and
            social interaction, creating a vibrant atmosphere that defines the
            town's character.
