              These celebrations serve multiple purposes—religious devotion,
              cultural preservation, social cohesion, and entertainment. They
              involve extensive community participation, with families

              events. Temple committees, youth organizations, and neighborhood
              groups coordinate activities, ensuring that traditions are
              properly maintained and passed to younger generations.

          <h3>Cultural Heritage and Traditions</h3>
          <p>
            Such occasions also attract residents who have moved away for work
            or education, creating opportunities for family reunions and
            maintaining connections to ancestral homes. The festivals become
            occasions for strengthening family bonds, renewing friendships, and
            reinforcing community identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Traditional arts, crafts, and culinary practices are preserved and
            showcased during these celebrations, ensuring that the unique
            cultural identity of Walasmulla continues to thrive while adapting
            to contemporary realities.
